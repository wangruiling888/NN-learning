# Recurrent Neural Network
## Why RNN?
Take time factor into consideration.
RNN network seems to have **_memory_**, people use it to analyze videos, context and something else with relation to **time**.
## Application of RNN
- NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- Voice Recognition
- Image Capturing
- Text Similarity Analysis
- Recommendation System (Youtube, Ebay, TaoBao)
## How RNN get "memory"?
Like common NN, RNN is made up of **Input Layer**, **Hidden Layer**, **Output Layer**.
